 The styles are loaded as the biblatex standard styles:

   \usepackage[style=footnote-dw]{biblatex}

 additional options, please consult the package

 4. Documentation
 ----------------

 The English documentation of biblatex-dw can be found in 
 the file 'biblatex-dw.pdf'. This file is intended for 
 viewing on a computer screen. A printable version can be 
 compiled from the file 'biblatex-dw.tex'. You only have to 
 comment the line 
   \input{biblatex-dw-screen}
 (i.e. put a % sign in front of it) and uncomment the line 
   \input{biblatex-dw-print}
 (i.e. delete the % sign at the beginning of this line).
 Note: The fonts may not be installed on your system. The 
 following fonts were used for the documentation:
 * Linux Libertine in running text
 * Linux Biolinum (part of the Libertine package) for 
   headings
 * BeraMono as typewriter font
 These fonts are freely available. If you do not have these
 fonts installed in your system or do not want to install 
 them, you can easily use another font. The relevant 
 settings can be found in the file 
 'biblatex-dw-preamble.tex'.
